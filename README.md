# AdventureGameProto
My first prototype game made in Unity!

- Yes the graphics & music are royality free (but I have practiced sprite-work in the past).

This is just to show the fundamental work I made.

**Didn't realize there's a 25MB file size limit; since my game is 89MB - I uploaded a gif of the gameplay instead.**
